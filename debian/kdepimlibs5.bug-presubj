The Debian KDE packages are built with the KDE4_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_LIB_EXPORT
option, which alters how CMake (the build system used by KDE) links to the KDE
libraries. This may cause KDE4 software to fail to build from source.

Please read http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/experimental_linking.html before
reporting bugs on build errors.
